# **App Name**: Tailwind Gradient Studio

## Core Features:

- Primary Gradient Designer: A tool to configure a three-color CSS gradient with options for hue, saturation, and lightness.
- Overlay Gradient Designer: A tool to configure a two-color CSS gradient that overlays the primary gradient with options for blend mode and opacity.
- Code Generation Tool: Generates and displays the Tailwind CSS, standard CSS, and RGB code snippets corresponding to the selected gradients, providing helpful info. The tool may or may not decide to add/remove browser-specific prefixes.
- Copy to Clipboard: Provides "one-click" buttons to copy the generated Tailwind CSS, CSS, and RGB codes to the clipboard.
- Project Showcase Section: Display previous web design projects, built on Next.js to impress the site user.
- Contact and Socials Section: Includes sections to list the site owner contact and socials handles for future colaboration with the site user.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#008080) to evoke a sense of sophistication and calm. This might usually be too obvious for many web apps, but seems correct given the specific focus on Tailwind CSS.
- Background color: Very light teal (#F0FFFF) creates a clean, calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFB347) for a contrasting highlight to guide user actions.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic, focused on design and style.
- Employ a card-based layout with 'glassmorphism' effects to highlight content and provide depth. Elements such as boxes will have blurred transparency.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations on user interactions (e.g., button hover effects) to provide feedback.
